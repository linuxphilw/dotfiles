# dotfiles
## Simple Scripts and basic .vimrc  and other dotfiles

+ Bugfix: Just appending config to .ssh/config as symlink breaks due to SELinux
+ Small but decent set of simple .vimrc options, more to be added over time
+ Three scripts should be run in order (1 2 3)
+ Features to Add:
    + A central file to keep track to directories
    + A central file to keep the list of config files to work with
