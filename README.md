# dotfiles
Simple Script and basic .vimrc  and other dotfiles 

Just realized that I need to split this up into a script to do initial backup of existing dotfiles
Then a script to create the symlinks
As github will now create the $HOME/dotfiles  directories and files for me when folks clone it

Updates will come later tomorrow :)
